**About ActiveCraft-Core** \
ActiveCraft-Core is a collaborative project between Silencio and CPlaiz, made explicitly for minecraft version 1.17 and updated to version 1.18. 
If you want to learn more, you can read the [Documentation](https://cplaiz.github.io/ActiveCraft-Core/). The plugin is nearing completion, meaning we will shift our
attention to other plugins in the ActiveCraft Series.

Please do not report bugs or post feature suggestions in the review section. Please use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CPlaiz/ActiveCraft-Core/issues) for this.
If you have questions, support for the plugin is given on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/EgRm6uGMHa).

**Why ActiveCraft?**
ActiveCraft is completely [open source](https://github.com/CPlaiz/ActiveCraft-Core). It is built to match your server, with your needs and what you want. Personalizing the plugin is as easy as changing a value in the config file, and we insist on excluding any plugin branding, so your server can look as professional as any other.
